Description
===========
The parser generates a syntatic tree by the source code of the program.
This process is subdivided in two parts:
 - Lexical analysis: the text is composed of tokens, which are selected by
                     the lexer.
 - Syntatical analysis: the tokens are analysed to compose the AST.  
Example:  
`(def a (+ 1 2)) => ["def", "a", ["+", 1, 2]]`  

Token types
-----------
These types identify the tokens generated by the lexer.
```c
enum {
    BULB_TOK_NIL = 0, 
    BULB_TOK_OPEN_BLOCK, 
    BULB_TOK_CLOSE_BLOCK, 
    BULB_TOK_OTHER, 
};
```
bulbParse
--------
Acquires the AST from the string, the AST is made by cons.
```c
bulbObj *bulbParse(char *exp);
```
bulbIsInt
---------
Verifies if the string can be converted to an integer (doesn't accept 
decimals).
```c
bool bulbIsInt(char *exp, unsigned len);
```
bulbIsFloat
-----------
Verifies if the string can be converted to a float (decimal part is 
needed).
```c
bool bulbIsFloat(char *exp, unsigned len);
```
bulbIsHex
---------
Verifies if the string can be converted to an integer.
0xFF => 255.
```c
bool bulbIsHex(char *exp, unsigned len);
```
bulbGenAtom
-----------
Converts the string to an atom object.
```c
bulbObj *bulbGenAtom(char *exp, unsigned len);
```
bulbLex
-------
Returns the type of the token contained in said string starting from its 
offset. This only works if the conversion is possible, therefore if it's not 
a parentesis, gets retured.
```c
unsigned bulbLex(char *exp, unsigned len, unsigned *offset, bulbObj **out);
```
bulbGenAst
----------
Generates an AST starting from the provided offset. It also 
checks if every open bracket matches a closed bracket.
```c
bulbObj *bulbGenAst(char *exp, unsigned len, unsigned *offset, bool open);
```
Exceptions
----------
```c
void bulb_err_missing_close_block();

void bulb_err_missing_open_block();

void bulb_err_missing_close_string();
```
